\section{Target and Detectors}
\subsection{Particle beam and target}
The proton beam, which is accelerated by the Super Proton Synchrotron, is directed into Beryllium. From the nuclear reaction between proton and Beryllium nucleus, a secondary hadron particle beam is created, which is the incoming particle beam for scattering experiment. In this project, the hadron beam is selected to be negative charged pion beam. But a small fraction of Kaon (\SI{2.4}{\percent}) can also exist in the incoming particle beam [ref]. The target, onto which pion beam is diverted, is liquid hydrogen stored in a \SI{40}{\centi\meter} height cylindrical container (see section )
