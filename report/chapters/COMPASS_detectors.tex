\section{Target and Detectors}
\subsection{Particle beam and target}
The proton beam, which is accelerated by the Super Proton Synchrotron, is directed into Beryllium. From the nuclear reaction between proton and Beryllium nucleus, a secondary hadron particle beam is created, which is the incoming particle beam for scattering experiment. In this project, the hadron beam is selected to be negative charged pion beam. Since Kaon can also exist in the ejectile particles from the nuclear reaction,
