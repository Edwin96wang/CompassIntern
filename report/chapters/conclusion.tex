\section{Conclusion}
In this project, to analysis the instability of different runs from 2008 COMPASS experiment, different parameters are extracted or calculated for each run. Among characteristic parameters such as the total number of events or invariant mass of three pions, the total invariant mass of out-going particles prove to be the most indicative parameters. Its correlation with ECAL1 photon number percentage ($\alpha$) encompasses most of abnormal runs found during stability test. The positive correlated regions also indicate the abnormality in angular distribution of recoil proton whereas negative correlated regions are related to the decline of ECAL2 averaged photon number per event. By checking out the logbook of experiment, some abnormality could be well explained such as the malfunctions of sandwich veto or solenoid magnet.
