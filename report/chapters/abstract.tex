The main goal of this project is to look for the abnormal runs from COMPASS experiment (2008). The COMPASS data being analyzed for each run were already preselected before the stability test. For seeking the abnormal runs, different parameters in each event are extracted and investigated, such as the position of primary vertices, angular distribution of recoiled protons, invariant mass of three pions, etc. By plotting values of the parameters from each different run, run number 70195, 69612, 70223, etc can be directly selected out because of disparities to the normal runs. The most significant abnormalities result from the inconsistency of half width value from pions and photons' invariant mass. The explanation of these disparities are made by further inspecting the corresponding photon number from ECAL2 and recoiled proton angular distribution.
